##DESCRIPTION:  
#   This file contains absolute paths to ONE OR MORE directories to backup independently.
#   Although it is possible to include as range of directories (or files), it is highly recommended
#   not do so, for ease of differentiating between backups.
#
##NOTES:	    Comments (starting with '#') are to be kept on seperate lines - these are not processed.
