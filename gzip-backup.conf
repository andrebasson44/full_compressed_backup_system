##DESCRIPTION:  config file used to populate script variables.
#
##NOTES:	    Do NOT use comments on the same line as setting.
#               Do NOT quote values.  I repeat, do NOT use any quotations around values.
#
# ======================================================================================

##By default the sync between souce and target dictates that the source directory HAS to exist
# and absolutely MUST not be empty ('no').  Change these values to 'yes' if the source/target is allowed to be empty.
# If in doubt, it is considered best/safest practice to use 'no' for sourceDirMayBeEmpty at all times, and 'yes' for
# targetDirMayBeEmpty.  In the case of targetDirMayBeEmpty, a 'no' is generally appropriate when the target is expected to have
# content, and when seeking to reduce risk of writing to an incorrect block device: 
#                   eg. failure to mount a block device (the intended backup target), then ending up backing up to the mount-point
#                       on the file system instead!!
#
sourceDirMayBeEmpty=no
targetDirMayBeEmpty=yes

##Maximum number of rsync & error log files to retain (respectively) at any one time - purge the current oldest when exceeding this number.
MAX_NUM_RSYNC_LOGS=3
MAX_NUM_ERROR_LOGS=3

##Regular expressions to accurately identify the Rsync and Error Logs respectively.
# Very useful when different types of log files might occupy the same path.
#
RSYNC_LOG_REGEXP=.*(rsync-)+.*(log)$
ERROR_LOG_REGEXP=.*(error-)+.*(log)$

##Temporary zip file storage on local host - released after succesful (or partially-succesfull) transfer to target
tmpArchDir=/home/andre/DELETE_ANYTIME/temp

##Tar switches
tarSwitches=-cvzpf

##Purge all previous backups in the target folder (targetDir)
# CAUTION: be absolute certain before you say 'yes'.
#
toPurgePreviousBackups=no

##RSYNC switch(es) to apply:  leave blank if no switch to apply, defaults shown
#
#  switches:
#       -avzhHAPR       -a = archive mode, equals -rlptgoD              -v = verbose    -z = compress file data during transfer
#                       -h = human readible numbers                     -R = use relative pathnames (also creates dirs on the fly)
#                       -P = combines --progress and --partial (preserves partially transfered files for future completion)
#			            -A = preserves ACLs (Access Control Lists; i.e. extended permissions)
#       --delete                delete extraneous files from destination directories 
#       --stats                 stats that are useful to review amount of traffic sent over network (handy for sysadmins)
#
prelimSwitches=-avzhHAP
delSwitch=--delete
statsSwitch=--stats


##SOURCE HOST VARIABLES - i.e. backup source
# ------------------------------------------
# comment in/out variables as required pending source being either local or remote
# NOTE: max 1 remote host between source and target allowed!!
# 
#source address - comment in if local host (then comment out the lines following)
sourceAddress=localhost

# sources's IP address (to be tested for reachability) - comment out for local host
#s_addr1=192.168.178.26

#alternative address for source (to be tested for reachability) - comment out for local host
#s_addr2=skyqode.ddns.net

#user name with which to authenticate on remote source host - comment out for local host
#s_userName=andre

#SSH authentication key of remote host - comment out for local host
#s_sshKey=/home/andre/.ssh/id_rsa_skyqode1

#TCP port SSH protocol monitors (uses) on remote host - comment out for local host
#s_sshPort=22


##TARGET HOST VARIABLES - i.e. backup target
# -----------------------------------------
# comment in/out variables as required pending source being either local or remote
# NOTE: max 1 remote host between source and target allowed!!
#
#location (on local or remote host) to backup to
targetDir=/home/andre/DELETE_ANYTIME/target

#target host address - comment in for local host (then comment out the lines following)
targetAddress=localhost

#target's IP address (to be tested for reachability) - comment out for local host
#t_addr1=192.168.178.26

#alternative address for target (to be tested for reachability) - comment out for local host
